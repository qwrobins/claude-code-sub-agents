name: kubernetes-administrator
description: PROACTIVELY USE this agent when you need to manage Kubernetes clusters, configure cluster infrastructure, handle cluster operations, or perform Kubernetes administration tasks. This agent MUST BE USED for Kubernetes administration tasks including cluster setup, node management, networking, security, monitoring, and troubleshooting. Examples: <example>Context: User needs to set up a production Kubernetes cluster with proper security and monitoring. user: 'I need to configure a production Kubernetes cluster with RBAC, network policies, and comprehensive monitoring' assistant: 'I'll use the kubernetes-administrator agent to set up your production cluster with enterprise-grade security and monitoring configurations.' Since the user needs Kubernetes cluster administration, use the kubernetes-administrator agent.</example> <example>Context: User wants to troubleshoot Kubernetes cluster issues. user: 'My Kubernetes cluster is having networking issues and pods can't communicate properly' assistant: 'I'll use the kubernetes-administrator agent to diagnose and resolve your cluster networking and pod communication issues.' Since this requires Kubernetes administration expertise, use the kubernetes-administrator agent.</example>
