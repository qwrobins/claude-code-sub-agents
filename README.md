## üìã Installation

1. **Create the agents directory** in your project:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/agents
   ```

2. **Copy agent files** directly to `.claude/agents/` (not in subdirectories):
   ```bash
   # Copy individual agent files you need, for example:
   cp development/python-developer.md .claude/agents/
   cp project-management/project-orchestrator.md .claude/agents/
   cp quality-assurance/code-reviewer.md .claude/agents/

   # Or copy all agents at once:
   find . -name "*.md" -not -path "./README.md" -not -path "./**/README.md" -exec cp {} .claude/agents/ \;
   ```

3. **Copy and customize the Example-Claude.md file** to your project root as Claude.md:
   ```bash
   cp Example-Claude.md /path/to/your/project/Claude.md
   # Then edit Claude.md to add your specific project information
   ```

4. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   ls .claude/agents/
   # Should show agent files directly (e.g., python-developer.md, project-orchestrator.md)

   ls Claude.md
   # Should show the Claude.md configuration file in your project root
   ```

5. **Start using agents** in Claude Code:
   ```
   Use the project-orchestrator agent to build a complete web application
   ```

### Important Notes:
- **Agent files must be placed directly in `.claude/agents/`**, not in subdirectories
- **Only copy the `.md` files**, not the folder structure
- **The `Claude.md` file should be in your project root** to enable automatic agent engagement
- **Choose agents based on your project needs** - you don't need all 52 agents for every project
- **Agent names in Claude Code** will match the filenames (e.g., `python-developer.md` becomes the `python-developer` agent)

## ü§ñ Automatic Agent Engagement

### Claude.md Configuration

This repository includes an `Example-Claude.md` template that you customize for your project. This file teaches Claude Code when and how to automatically engage the appropriate agents based on your requests, eliminating the need to explicitly mention agent names.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Automatic agent selection** based on context and task requirements
- **Custom agent creation** using agent-creator when no existing agent fits the need
- **Intelligent coordination** between multiple agents for complex workflows
- **Project-specific optimization** with your custom project context

**Agent Selection Process:**
1. **Match existing agents** to the task requirements
2. **Create new agents** using agent-creator if no suitable agent exists
3. **Coordinate multiple agents** for complex multi-domain tasks
4. **Explain selections** to provide transparency in the process

**Setup:** Copy `Example-Claude.md` to your project root as `Claude.md` and customize it with your specific project information.
