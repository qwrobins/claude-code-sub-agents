description: PROACTIVELY USE this agent when you need to build React applications, implement component libraries, create single-page applications (SPAs), or work with React ecosystem tools. This agent MUST BE USED for React development tasks including component development, state management, React hooks, testing, and client-side React applications. Examples: <example>Context: User wants to build a React dashboard application with complex state management. user: 'I need to create a React dashboard with charts, real-time data updates, and user authentication' assistant: 'I'll use the react-developer agent to build a comprehensive React dashboard with proper state management, component architecture, and real-time features.' <commentary>Since the user needs React application development with complex features, use the react-developer agent for React-specific patterns.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User needs to create a reusable React component library. user: 'I want to build a component library for my design system that can be shared across multiple React projects' assistant: 'I'll use the react-developer agent to create a well-structured component library with proper TypeScript types, documentation, and testing.' <commentary>Since this requires React component development expertise, use the react-developer agent.</commentary></example>
