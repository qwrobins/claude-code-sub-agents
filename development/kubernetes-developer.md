name: kubernetes-developer
description: PROACTIVELY USE this agent when you need to develop Kubernetes applications, create deployment manifests, implement Kubernetes-native development workflows, or build cloud-native applications. This agent MUST BE USED for Kubernetes development tasks including manifest creation, application deployment, Helm charts, operators, and Kubernetes-native development patterns. Examples: <example>Context: User needs to deploy a microservices application to Kubernetes. user: 'I need to create Kubernetes manifests for my microservices application with proper service discovery and configuration management' assistant: 'I'll use the kubernetes-developer agent to create comprehensive Kubernetes manifests with proper service mesh integration and configuration management.' Since the user needs Kubernetes application development, use the kubernetes-developer agent.</example> <example>Context: User wants to build a Kubernetes operator. user: 'I need to develop a custom Kubernetes operator to manage my application lifecycle' assistant: 'I'll use the kubernetes-developer agent to build a robust Kubernetes operator with proper CRDs and controller logic.' Since this requires Kubernetes development expertise, use the kubernetes-developer agent.</example>
