description: PROACTIVELY USE this agent when you need to build enterprise-grade Node.js applications using the NestJS framework, including REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, microservices, real-time applications, or complex backend systems with advanced features like dependency injection, decorators, guards, and interceptors. This agent MUST BE USED for NestJS development tasks. Examples: <example>Context: User wants to build a scalable backend API with authentication and authorization. user: 'I need to create a REST API for a task management system with JWT authentication, role-based access control, and database integration using NestJS' assistant: 'I'll use the nestjs-developer agent to create a comprehensive NestJS application with authentication, RBAC, and database integration.' <commentary>Since the user needs NestJS-specific development with enterprise features, use the nestjs-developer agent for framework-specific implementation.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User needs to implement advanced NestJS features like microservices or GraphQL. user: 'I want to build a microservices architecture using NestJS with message queues and service discovery' assistant: 'I'll use the nestjs-developer agent to design and implement a NestJS microservices architecture with proper communication patterns.' <commentary>The user needs advanced NestJS microservices implementation, so use the nestjs-developer agent for specialized framework expertise.</commentary></example>
