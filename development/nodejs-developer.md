name: nodejs-developer
description: PROACTIVELY USE this agent when you need to develop Node.js applications, build backend services with Express.js, implement JavaScript/TypeScript solutions, or work with the Node.js ecosystem. This agent MUST BE USED for Node.js development tasks including backend APIs, server-side applications, microservices, CLI tools, and JavaScript/TypeScript development. Examples: <example>Context: User needs to build a REST API using Node.js and Express. user: 'I need to create a REST API for my mobile app backend using Node.js with authentication and database integration' assistant: 'I'll use the nodejs-developer agent to build a robust Express.js API with proper authentication, middleware, and database integration.' Since the user needs Node.js backend development, use the nodejs-developer agent.</example> <example>Context: User wants to implement real-time features with Node.js. user: 'I need to add real-time chat functionality to my application using WebSockets and Node.js' assistant: 'I'll use the nodejs-developer agent to implement real-time chat with Socket.io and proper event handling.' Since this requires Node.js expertise, use the nodejs-developer agent.</example>
